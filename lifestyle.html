  <h6>As a runner, it is recommended that you also perform certain life habits that can enhance your running workout and health.</h6>

    <h2>WHAT TO EAT</h2>
    <p>Runners are recommended to eat more carbs & protein than sedentary people, as they are needed to give you more energy. Also, the more miles you run in a week, the more food you need to eat to get enough energy, as training intensively can put the body in an inflammatory state. We also recommend you to get enough vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron, as they are lost through sweating.</p>

    <div class="column2" style="background-color:#627C85;">
    <div id="index">
    <h2>WHEN TO EAT</h2>
    <p>Before a run: eat a small meal/snack with lots of carbs and little fat/fiber 45-90 min before <br>
      After a run: eat a protein and carb-rich snack/meal for muscle recovery <br>
     *See below for a sample meal plan.

    <div id="index">
    <h2>SLEEP NEEDS </h2>
    <p> A runner also needs to get more sleep than a sedentary person, as it is needed as recovery for muscles. Being sleep-deprived can make your muscles ache more and be more injury-prone. Depending on your age, we recommend 7.5 hours min for an adult, 9 hours min for a teen, and 10 hours for a tween/child.</p>

    <h2> GETTING PROFESSIONAL HELP</h2>
   
    <p>Since every person has different nutritional needs, if you need help finding a more specific meal plan or have questions about how much protein, carbs, etc. is right for you, we recommend you consult a registered dietition. </p>

    <p>*Another top tip we recommend is to reduce the amount of sitting in a day when not running. More research has shown that even though one exercises daily, spending all other hours sitting still can damage their health. Also, this habit can cause you to be more injury-prone, as the sitting position can cause some muscles to be tight/overstretched. Since school and work are mostly sedentary, we recommend you to stand up or walk around for a few minutes after sitting for an hour or two.</p>
