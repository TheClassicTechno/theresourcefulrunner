  <h6>Though running seems like such an easy activity (you are only moving faster than walking), it needs to be treated as an actual sport. If one has a sedentary lifestyle, it is best to start off with jogging slowly a little bit and then gradually running more miles in order to prevent potential injuries. </h6>

    <h2>TOP TIP</h2>
    <p>The more gradually you ease into running, in terms of time, days, and/or miles, the lower chance you have to receive an injury. Some experts recommend a jog-walk method where you alternate between each for 1-8 minutes. </p>

     Thurs: jog 20 minutes<br>

    <h2>GRADUAL & CONSISTENT</h2>
    <p>After you get comfortable with an easy run-walk schedule, slowly increase the minutes you run while decreasing the minutes you walk. </p>

    <h2>JUST IN CASE</h2>
   
    <p>If you notice at any time that you have persistent leg pain or foot pain, try decreasing the intensity of your training schedule and walk more than you run. Then, after a while, slowly run more while walking less. </p>

    <p>*Though this is more important for high intensity or experienced runners, it is important to buy the right type of shoes in order to reduce chances of injury. Below are examples of what shoes to buy based on foot shape and how your foot strikes the ground when running. </p>
  <h6>Running Shoes</h6> 
    <h2>Example Shoe Brands to Buy</h2>
<p>To better identify if you overpronate or not, check with a worker at a local running shoe store such as Gazelle's.</p>
<table style="width:50%">
  <tr >
    <th >Control Shoes</th>
    <th>Neutral Shoes</th>
  
  </tr >
  <tr >
    <td>if you overpronate (ankles lean inward)
</td>
    <td>if your ankles lean outward or don't lean at all (distribute weight on the outside of feet and ankles as you run/walk)
</td>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brooks Ravenna, Brooks Adrenaline, Saucony Guide, Saucony Omni, New Balance 860, Mizuno Wave Inspire, Asics GT 2000
</td>
    <td>
Brooks Ghost, Saucony Ride, New Balance 880, Mizuno Wave Rider, Asics Gel Cumulus
</td>
   
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>has denser material on inside of shoe to offset overpronation (ankles roll excessively to the inside as you run/walk)
</td>
    <td> has midsole of same density throughout shoe 
</td>
